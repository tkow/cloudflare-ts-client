# What is this

CloudFlare Typescript client generated by https://github.com/Himenon/openapi-typescript-code-generator.

## Caveat

- This library support typescript and esm for tree shaking. (Not support commonjs)
- CloudFlare OAS looks less maintenance, which means you can't take benefits and fully types and you man need to extend types manually.
- Therefore, we won't publish it to npm unless official support OAS gets correct. If you want to use this api client, I recommend to fork this and edit openapi.yaml apis sections you'll use, and run gen.ts yourself, but welcome to PR to fix openapi.yaml to be correct.
